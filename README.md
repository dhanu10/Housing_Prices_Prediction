## General Information
- This assignment helps reenforce some of the concepts about linear regression and implement them in practice
- Data is provided from a Australian market about Salesprice of housing and other independent variables .
- Business goal is to purchase the properties which will give higer yield / salesprice
- Dataset has mix of numerical , ordinal and discrete features and model needs to be built to find significant features impacting price and to predict price
- Goal is to build multiple linear regression , Lasso and Ridge regression using normalisation and choosing right hyperparameters using techniques like K-fold

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Various methods like EDA, feature selection, multicolinearity assessment were used. Data was scaled and fit against regression model.
- To predict housing prices , significant variables are - OverallQual, TotalBsmtSF, GrLivArea
- Normalisation factors can be found to avoid overfitting of the data
